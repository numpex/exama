<p>reproducibility is an essential ingredient of the scientific enterprise.  The ability to reproduce results builds trust so that we can rely on the results as foundations for future scientific exploration. Presently, the fields of computational and computing sciences provide two opposing definitions of reproducible and replicable. In computational sciences, reproducible research means authors provide all necessary data and computer codes to run analyses again, so others can re-obtain the results. The concept was adopted and extended by several communities, where it was distinguished from replication: collecting new data to address the same question, and arriving at consistent findings.</p>

(O3} to identify and co-design Methodological and Algorithmic Patterns:: at exascale that can be reused efficiently in large scale applications (e.g., in weather forecast);
(O4) to enable AI algorithms:: to attain performances at exascale, exploiting the methods (O1) and the libraries (O2) developed; and

3-Software ecosystem and contributions</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Exa-MA project involves the utilization of various software tools and libraries across different work packages to address the research objectives. The figure below provides an overview of the software ecosystem associated with each work package.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_internal_organization_cross_project_collaborations_and_deliverables"><a class="anchor" href="#_internal_organization_cross_project_collaborations_and_deliverables"></a>3. Internal organization, cross-project collaborations and deliverables</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Exa-MA project has a robust internal organization structure that promotes inter-WP collaboration and ensures coherence across the project&#8217;s activities and deliverables.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">WP0 (Project Management)</dt>
<dd>
<p>oversees the coordination of the entire project. This includes maintaining the Management Plan Handbook, setting timelines, and defining deliverables for each of the work packages. WP0 also ensures that all project activities align with the overall objectives and that resources are allocated efficiently. Regular reports and feedback sessions are held to monitor progress and address any issues that may arise.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">The Management Plan Handbook</dt>
<dd>
<p>(the first deliverable of WP0) acts as a central resource for the project, detailing the objectives, roles, responsibilities, timelines, and deliverables for each work package. It also outlines the processes for inter-WP collaboration and communication, ensuring that all work packages understand their dependencies and relationships with others.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Regular Inter-WP Meetings</dt>
<dd>
<p>are held to facilitate collaboration and ensure coherence across the project. These meetings provide an opportunity for the teams to update each other on their progress, discuss any challenges they are facing, and explore opportunities for collaboration.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WP7 (Software Development, Coordination, and Co-design)</dt>
<dd>
<p>works closely with WP0 to coordinate the project&#8217;s software development efforts and ensure the integration of results from all other WPs. This includes establishing a common software release plan, coordinating co-design activities, and ensuring the quality and coherence of the project&#8217;s software and results.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Coherence of Deliverables</dt>
<dd>
<p>The project also ensures Coherence of Deliverables across the project. This is achieved through common deliverables and software release plans coordinated by WP0 and WP7, which ensure that the work done in each WP aligns with the overall project timeline and contributes to the overarching objectives.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Inter-WP collaboration is also natural in the following sense.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">WP1 (Geometric and Physics-based Modeling)</dt>
<dd>
<p>provides the foundation for many of the other WPs, as it develops space-time discretization, mesh generation, mesh adaptation and coupling strategies that will be used throughout the project.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WP2 (Surrogate Models and Machine Learning) and WP3 (Numerical Kernels and Coupled Solvers)</dt>
<dd>
<p>both rely on the full-order models developed in WP1. WP2 works on creating surrogate models and using machine learning for complex physical problems based on these models, while WP3 designs numerical kernels and solvers to deal with large-scale problems derived from these models.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WP4 (Inverse Problems and Data Assimilation)</dt>
<dd>
<p>directly draws on the work from WP1, WP2, and WP3. It uses models and solvers to frame and solve inverse problems. It also utilizes the surrogate models from WP2 for the formulation of inverse problems and for uncertainty quantification.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WP5 (Optimization)</dt>
<dd>
<p>can use the surrogate models from WP2 for surrogate-based optimization. It also relies on the solvers from WP3 to solve large-scale optimization problems, and it may feed back into WP4 by providing optimization strategies for inverse problem-solving.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WP6 (Uncertainty Quantification)</dt>
<dd>
<p>works closely with all the other WPs, especially WP4 (Inverse Problems and Data Assimilation), as uncertainty quantification is often tied to solving inverse problems. It can also use the surrogate models developed in WP2 to model uncertainties in complex multi-physics problems.</p>

While this project does not directly work with quantum computing, the development of algorithms and computational models capable of harnessing the potential of exascale computing could provide valuable insights for future integration with quantum systems.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">Artificial Intelligence (AI) Integration</dt>
<dd>
<p>AI and machine learning methods are increasingly being integrated into scientific computing for tasks such as data analysis, prediction, and even computational model design. The Exa-MA project&#8217;s work on AI algorithms (WP2, WP4, WP5, WP7) is directly contributing to the integration of AI and exascale computing, addressing one of the key future challenges in the field.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">Resilience and Error Handling</dt>
<dd>
<p>As systems scale, the likelihood of errors increases. New methods for ensuring system resilience and efficient error handling will be needed. The work in this project on improving system resilience and robustness (WP3, WP7) will be directly relevant to future challenges in these areas.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Complexity Management</dt>
<dd>
<p>As models and simulations become more complex, efficient and effective ways to manage this complexity are required. This involves the development of more sophisticated modeling and solving techniques, optimization strategies, and uncertainty quantification methods. The Exa-MA project&#8217;s focus on geometric and physics-based modeling (WP1), surrogate models and machine learning (WP2), numerical kernels and solvers (WP3), inverse problems and data assimilation (WP4), optimization (WP5), and uncertainty quantification (WP6) all contribute to managing this increasing complexity.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Software Infrastructure</dt>
<dd>
<p>With the growth in complexity and scale, there is a critical need for robust, efficient, and user-friendly software infrastructure to support exascale computing. The Exa-MA project, through WP7, aims to contribute to this by developing a strong framework for non-regression benchmarking tests, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), and containerization. These activities ensure the reliability and robustness of the software tools developed, facilitating their integration into the broader European exascale software stack.</p>

<p>Furthermore, WP7 aims to contribute to Software Development Kits (SDKs) and demonstrate the project&#8217;s results via a showroom. It will also provide training materials on exascale toolboxes, mini-apps and proxy-apps to enable wider use of the project&#8217;s outputs. These activities will ensure the project&#8217;s outputs are accessible and useful to the broader scientific and technical community, driving the adoption and impact of exascale computing solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this way, the Exa-MA project is not only addressing immediate challenges in exascale computing but is also strategically positioning its activities to meet future challenges in the field, paving the way for advancements in zettascale computing and beyond.
