On January 14 and 15, 2025, the Exa-MA project met for a General Assembly rich in exchanges and perspectives. 
This event, held at the University of Strasbourg, gathered 83 participants – including members of the Scientific Board, external partners, and young recruits – with 15 joining online, to share progress, strengthen collaboration among the Work Packages (WPs), and plan the next steps of the program.

== Program

=== Tuesday, January 14, 2025

* **Welcome and General Presentations:**  
  The day began with a welcome coffee followed by an overall presentation of NumPex and Exa-MA, led by Hélène Barucq and Christophe Prud'homme, including a Q&A session.
  
* **Highlighting the New Recruits:**  
  Several sessions were dedicated to introducing new recruits from different areas (CMAP, internal teams, etc.), showcasing the dynamism and renewal within the project.

* **Transversal Workshops and Exchanges:**  
  Plenary workshops and breakout sessions addressed intra-project interactions – notably around Exa-Soft and Exa-DI – as well as topics specific to the transversal groups on AI and accelerators.

* **Meeting of the Scientific Board:**  
  At the end of the day, the Board convened to discuss strategic orientations and challenges related to the various Work Packages.

The day concluded with a convivial dinner with informal exchanges among participants.

=== Wednesday, January 15, 2025

* **Workshop on External Interactions:**  
  The morning was dedicated to a plenary workshop led by Hélène Barucq and Christophe Prud'homme, focusing on interactions with external partners, thereby reinforcing Exa-MA's collaborative scope.

* **Parallel Sessions and Feedback:**  
  Three parallel workshops addressed the following themes:
  
  - **WP1 and WP3:**  
    Challenges of discretization, solvers, and mesh generation/partitioning, with particular emphasis on multiphysics couplings.
  
  - **WP2 and WP5:**  
    Focused on optimization and artificial intelligence, with perspectives ahead of the next NumPex call.
  
  - **WP4 and WP6:**  
    Convergence between inversion, uncertainty quantification, and visualization of data in very high-dimensional spaces, linked to various applications (geosciences, medical imaging, etc.).

* **Conclusion and Informal Exchanges:**  
  The day ended with a feedback session, followed by informal exchanges that helped consolidate synergies among the WPs and identify new avenues for collaboration.

== Key Points and Perspectives

* **Strengthening Internal Collaboration:**  
  The workshops and discussions highlighted the complementarity between the various Exa-MA WPs. Initiatives such as collectively drafting state-of-the-art reviews and coordinating thesis supervision were mentioned to further reinforce the project's synergy.

* **Focus on the Software Ecosystem and Reproducibility:**  
  Discussions underscored the importance of a robust software ecosystem, integrating CICD pipelines and modern tools (SPACK, GUIX HPC, containers) to ensure the sustainability of developments at the exascale level.

* **Involvement of External Partners:**  
  The meeting helped solidify ties with industrial and academic partners through dedicated workshops and the planning of future events, to better disseminate the project's progress.
