Welcome to the Exa-MA Project website—part of the PEPR NumPEx initiative dedicated to advancing methods and algorithms for exascale computing. Our work spans cutting-edge numerical methods, open-source software libraries, AI integration, and demonstrators that validate our approach to exascale performance.

== Overview

Exa-MA is focused on:
* Developing robust algorithms and methods tailored for exascale architectures.
* Contributing to software libraries that abstract hardware complexity.
* Integrating AI-driven techniques in simulation, model reduction, and optimization.
* Delivering demonstrators, mini-apps, and proxy apps to showcase our progress.

Learn more about our project on the xref:about.adoc[About] page.
