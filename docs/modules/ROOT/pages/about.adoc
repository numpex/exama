= About Exa-MA

The Exa-MA project is part of the PEPR NumPEx initiative and aims to push the frontiers of exascale computing by developing cutting-edge numerical methods, algorithms, and software libraries. 

Our mission includes:

* Developing advanced methods tailored for exascale architectures.
* Contributing to open-source software libraries that abstract hardware complexity.
* Integrating AI techniques for simulation, model reduction, and optimization.
* Delivering demonstrators, mini-apps, and proxy apps to validate our approaches.

== Consortium and Funding
Exa-MA is carried out by a consortium of leading institutions:

* CEA
* École Polytechnique
* Inria
* Sorbonne Université
* Université de Strasbourg

The project has received a requested budget of 6.255 M€ (paid by ANR) for a total cost of approximately 24.417 M€. 
Our consortium involves partners such as the CNRS and several universities.

== Roadmap
A detailed project timeline with milestones, deliverables, and key events is available upon request. 
We continue to work toward the successful deployment of an exascale software ecosystem.
