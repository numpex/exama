= Our Partners

The Exa-MA project brings together a diverse consortium of research institutions dedicated to advancing exascale computing. We have both “beneficiary” and “non‐beneficiary” partners, along with a grant & consortium agreement structure that ensures smooth collaboration. “Small” partners typically have 1–2 people actively involved, while “large” partners may have 10 or more.
