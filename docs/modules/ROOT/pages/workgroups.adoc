= NumPEx Transversal Workgroups

// image::numpex-workgroups.png[NumPEx Transversal Workgroups, align="center", width=80%]

The NumPEx program organizes multiple cross-cutting workgroups (WG) that span all of its constituent projects, including Exa-MA. 
These workgroups foster collaboration, share expertise, and address broad challenges that are relevant to exascale computing as a whole. 

Below is an overview of the key NumPEx workgroups, their leads, and the representatives from Exa-MA.

== Accelerated Architectures and Programming Models

Leads:: S. Thibault, M. Pérache

Focuses on harnessing accelerators (such as GPUs and specialized hardware) and exploring programming models suited for heterogeneous, high-performance architectures. Key objectives include:
- Evaluating performance and portability across CPU-GPU-FPGA platforms
- Developing best practices for programming models (MPI+X, OpenMP, etc.)
- Addressing code modernization and tooling for accelerated computing

Exa-MA Representatives::
- Philippe Helluy (mailto:helluy@unistra.fr[helluy@unistra.fr])

== AI

Leads:: T. Moreau, E. Franck, J. Bobin

Addresses the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and High-Performance Computing (HPC), encompassing:
- AI for HPC: leveraging ML/AI techniques to enhance HPC workflows (e.g., surrogate modeling, code auto-tuning)
- HPC for AI: accelerating large-scale AI tasks and deep learning workloads
- Cross-pollination of methods and shared infrastructure among NumPEx projects
