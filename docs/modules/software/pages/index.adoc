== Introduction & WP7 Overview

Work Package 7 (WP7) provides the “glue” for Exa‑MA, delivering the CI/CD framework, containerized environments, packaging standards, benchmarking suite, training materials, and automated deployment pipelines that bind together the methodological developments from WP1-WP6 into reproducible, high‑performance demonstrators on supercomputers.

== Objectives and Deliverables

* **Demonstrators**  
  - Level 1 mini‑apps (single‑WP exercises)  
  - Level 2 mini‑apps (cross‑WP exercises)  
  - Level 3 proxy‑apps (full WP integration)  

* **Benchmarking suite & KPI reports**  
  - Performance, stability, deployment time, user adoption  

* **Automated deployment platform**  
  - Uniform Docker/Singularity images  
  - SPAC & Guix‑HPC packages  

* **Training materials & showroom**  
  - Tutorials, FAQs, recorded workshops  
  - Web‑based portal showcasing live demos

== Governance and Roles

* **Steering Committee**  
  - Representatives from WP1-WP6 + WP7 leads  

* **Technical Referents**  
  - CI/CD pipelines  
  - Containerization & packaging  
  - Benchmarking & KPI tracking  
  - Training & documentation  

* **Demonstrator Leads**  
  - Assigned binômes (developer + WP expert) per demonstrator  

== CI/CD Pipelines

* **Version Control & Artifact Management**  
  - Git repository structure, tagging conventions, artifact registry  

* **Automated Build & Test Workflows**  
  - Build → unit tests → integration tests → container image builds  

* **Deployment to Test Environments**  
  - Staging cluster for full‑scale smoke tests  

* **Pipeline Templates & Best Practices**  
  - Examples in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

== Containerization & Packaging

* **Docker & Singularity Images**  
  - Base images for common HPC stacks (MPI, CUDA, etc.)  

* **SPAC & Guix‑HPC Packaging**  
  - Declarative package definitions for reproducibility  

* **Image Registry & Versioning**  
  - Tagging by WP, demonstrator level, software version  

== Benchmarking & KPI Tracking

* **Key Performance Indicators**  
  - Execution time, throughput, memory footprint, scalability  

* **Automated Data Collection**  
  - Scripts to extract logs, metrics, energy consumption  

* **Dashboards & Reports**  
  - Shared Grafana/Prometheus dashboards  
  - Quarterly KPI summary reports

== Demonstrator Development Process

=== Demonstrator Levels

* **Level 1 (WP‑Specific Mini‑Apps)**  
* **Level 2 (Cross‑WP Mini‑Apps)**  
* **Level 3 (Proxy‑Apps covering ≥3 WPs)**  

=== Project Template & Responsibilities

* **Repository Skeleton**  
  - `src/`, `tests/`, `ci/`, `containers/`, `docs/`  
* **CI/CD Configuration**  
  - Pre‑configured pipeline definitions  
* **Binôme Assignment**  
  - Developer + WP expert collaborate on test definitions, benchmarks, packaging

== Communication & Collaborative Tools

* **GitHub Project**  
  - Kanban board with issue templates, milestones, labels  

* **Slack**  
  - Channels: `#wp7-ci`, `#wp7-containers`, `#wp7-benchmarks`, `#wp7-training`  

* **Documentation Hub**  
  - GitHub Pages or internal Wiki  

== Training Plan & Capacity Building

* **Workshops & Tutorials**  
  - Monthly hands‑on sessions: CI/CD, containers, benchmarking  

* **On‑Demand Materials**  
  - Recorded videos, step‑by‑step guides, FAQ  

* **Mentorship & Office Hours**  
  - Weekly drop‑in sessions with technical referents  

== Maintenance, Support & Risk Management

* **Issue Tracking & Support**  
  - Dedicated Slack channel + GitHub issue queue  

* **Risk Register**  
  - Tool/version compatibility, HPC site differences, network policies  

* **Mitigation Plans**  
  - Regular upgrade cycles, multi‑site test matrix, fallback container images
